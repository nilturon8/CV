# CV Website Project (EN)

## ðŸ‘¤ Target Reviewer Persona
**Name:** Anna â€” HR Specialist at a tech company. She has limited time to screen rÃ©sumÃ©s and needs key info quickly: education, experience, skills, and projects. The site must be clear, visual, mobileâ€‘friendly, and fast.

## ðŸ—‚ Information Architecture
Singleâ€‘page layout for quick scanning. The sticky header includes anchor links (About, Skills, Experience, Education, Projects, Certifications, Contact). **About** shows a short intro and a photo. **Skills** uses compact chips. **Experience** and **Education** are cards ordered in reverse chronology, with a vertical timeline. **Projects** is a grid of cards with links to repos/demos. **Certifications** includes badges and a Languages subsection. **Contact** groups email, LinkedIn, and GitHub.

## ðŸŽ¨ Visual Design
Indigo + neutral palette. Dark mode supported (stored in localStorage). System UI font for performance. Cards with rounded corners and subtle shadows create hierarchy. Layout is responsive via CSS Grid; on small screens, columns collapse to one.

## ðŸ§° How to Use
1. Replace placeholder links (LinkedIn, project URLs) in `index.html`.
2. Put your headshot in `assets/avatar-placeholder.svg` (or replace with a PNG/JPG).
3. The Download button points to `assets/resume.pdf` (already included â€” copied from your uploaded PDF).
4. Update the Open Graph URL if you deploy to a custom domain.

## ðŸš€ Deploy
- **GitHub Pages**: enable Pages on your repo (root) and the site will be served at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## â™¿ Accessibility
Semantic headings, visible focus states, color contrast. Smooth scrolling and active link highlight for navigation.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Notes
No frameworks â€” just HTML, CSS, and a tiny bit of vanilla JS (theme toggle, smooth scroll, print). Structured data (JSONâ€‘LD) is added for better SEO as a Person profile.
