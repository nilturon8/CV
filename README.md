### Information Architecture
The page‚Äôs structure follows a **clear vertical hierarchy** that makes navigation intuitive and quick.  
At the top, the **header** contains the name and navigation bar, which stays fixed for easy access to each section. Each navigation link uses smooth scrolling to reach its section without breaking the flow.  

The **main content** is divided into several sections:

1. **About** ‚Äì A short introduction with photo, age, contact details, and short biography summarizing who I am and what I study.  
2. **Skills** ‚Äì A list of technical and soft skills, grouped into web, tooling, and teamwork categories for readability.  
3. **Experience** ‚Äì A timeline presenting professional history, including my current job as a cook and previous tutoring experience.  
4. **Education** ‚Äì A summary of academic background with emphasis on my Computer Engineering degree at the University of Girona.  
5. **Contact** ‚Äì Links to email, GitHub, and LinkedIn for direct communication.

This structure ensures that information flows logically ‚Äî from personal introduction to professional details and contact ‚Äî following a narrative similar to a CV but enhanced for online browsing.  
The content remains focused and compact, avoiding redundancy, which helps users reach relevant data in under 30 seconds.

### Visual Design
The visual design follows the **principles of clarity, contrast, and simplicity**.  
I used a **dark theme** with shades of navy and slate to create a professional tone while maintaining good contrast for readability. The **accent color** (light blue) highlights headings, active links, and call-to-action buttons, ensuring users can easily identify interactive elements.  

Typography is clean and modern, using a **sans-serif font** for both titles and body text to reinforce readability on digital screens. Line heights and spacing have been carefully adjusted to create breathing room, making long paragraphs easy to read.  

The layout uses **CSS Grid and Flexbox** for responsive alignment. On desktop screens, sections display in multiple columns (e.g., About section with text + image), while on mobile, content stacks vertically to maintain accessibility.  

Each section employs subtle shadows and rounded corners to give depth without exaggeration.  
Icons and small transitions, such as the smooth scroll and theme toggle, add interactivity while maintaining minimalism.  
Overall, the design intends to communicate **professional maturity** and **technical precision**, reflecting both my engineering background and my attention to detail in user experience.
